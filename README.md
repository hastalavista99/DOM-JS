This is my JavaScript DOM Manipulation Journey

I will list some functions and favorite methods


document.querySelector();- this is used to select html elements according to their id or class, use '#' for id and '.' for class

document.getElementById(); - returns the  elements with the specified id

document.getElementByClassName();- returns element with the  selected class

addEventListener(); used to check for specified events and perform actions when said event happens

parentElement(); refers to the element above the current element in the DOM tree


toString(); this method is used to convert integer into string

setInterval(); used to set time intervals between certain events, the intervals are in miliseconds

innerHTML();
